        <h2>Operating System</h2>
        <p>
          I started off with Ubuntu (used it like, 2 days), then switched to
          Debian for a few months, then used Void for 3 months or so. I was
          satisfied, Void Linux is a great distribution (and so is Debian btw).
        </p>
        <p>
          As you know (or maybe you don't) Void Linux uses the runit init
          system. But later on I needed systemd back because of compatibility
          issues with an app. I didn't go back to Debian, I installed Arch. Arch
          is just amazing, AUR, documentation, rolling release (just like Void),
          and a blazing fast package manager (just like Void). I can, but I
          didn't went back to Void as I didn't feel the need to.
        </p>
        <p>
          I thought about switching to Artix but systemd just work fine so...
        </p>
        <h2>Integrated Development Environment</h2>
        <p>
          I was using VSCode for 9 months, but I am trying to escape Microsoft
          so I use Neovim now. It's such a lovely IDE.
        </p>
        <p>
          I liked
          <a href="https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim"
            >kickstart.nvim</a
          >
          and <a href="https://nvchad.com/">NvChad</a>, but nothing feels better
          than your own Neovim config.
        </p>
        <h2>Internet Browser</h2>
        <p>
          I used ungoogled-chromium for a while, now I use Firefox with
          Arkenfox's user.js
        </p>

        <h2>File Manager</h2>
        <p>
          Just use the shell, it's more convenient, if you need drag and drop
          features just use a minimal one like PCManFM.
        </p>
        <h2>Media Player</h2>
        <p>I use mpv.</p>
        <h2>Image/PDF viewer</h2>
        <p>Using nsxiv and zathura.</p>
